Red Hat Container Development Kit
=============================================

Red Hat Container Development Kit (CDK) is a set of tools that helps you quickly and easily set up an environment for developing and testing containerized applications on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux platform. Red Hat CDK is available for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux operating systems, thus allowing you to use your favorite platform to produce applications that are ready to deploy in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux ecosystem.

Red Hat CDK is a part of the Red Hat Developers program, which provides tools, resources, and support for developers who wish to utilize Red Hat solutions and products to create applications, both locally and in the cloud. For additional information and to register to become a part of the program, visit [developers.redhat.com](http://developers.redhat.com). 

Installation Instructions
=========================
Detailed installation instructions for setting up Red Hat CDK on each of the supported platforms (Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux) are available in the [CDK Installation Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/container-development-kit-guide)

Getting Started
===============
The [Getting Started Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/getting-started-with-container-development-kit/) describes the individual components that form Red Hat CDK, followed by instructions on how to obtain, install, and configure the components, so that you can start using the resulting environment to interact with containers and develop containerized applications.

An additional document, the Container Development Guide, will be published with The GA release of the CDK. This guide contains practical usage examples, including advanced topics such as developing multi-container applications and container orchestration using Kubernetes or OpenShift.

Updated releases of the CDK will be available to download from the Red Hat Customer portal, [access.redhat.com](https://access.redhat.com/) under Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
