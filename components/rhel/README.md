The Vagrantfiles in these directories assume that you have a RHEL Vagrant box. They also assume that you have registered the boxes with the Red Hat Subscription services. However, that can be a little challenging (from an order of operations perspective), so we would recommend that you download and install the [adb-vagrant-registration](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-vagrant-registration) and use that to register the VM on "vagrant up."
